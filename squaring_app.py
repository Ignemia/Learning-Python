# This is how you make comments
# Haven't yet figured out how to effectively make multi-line comments - will work on that
# def is something like "function" in javascript
# weird Python doesn't use curly braces
# I would love to figure out how to force types for function parameters
# I should get people to input. I need to get the grip of handleing user inputs
def square(a):
    # wow... this actually works... Python is easy
    return print(a*a)

# this is weird you define variables without declaring either whether it is variable or constant for as much as I know atm. Not even datatypes. This feels off
user_input = input()
# this is simple. Method input is the only thing you need to get user to input into terminal.
square(user_input)
# ah s#17 doens't even work for numbers what is wrong
